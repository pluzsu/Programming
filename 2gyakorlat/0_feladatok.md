5. A mathematician named Ulam proposed generating a sequence of numbers from any positive integer n (n > 0) as follows:
   
      - If n is 1, stop.
      - If n is even, the next number is n/2.
      - If n is odd, the next number is 3*n + 1.
      - Continue with this process until reaching 1.   
 Here are some examples for the first few integers.

   2 ->  1   
   3 -> 10 ->  5 -> 16 ->  8 ->  4 ->  2 ->  1   
   4 ->  2 ->  1   
   5 -> 16 ->  8 ->  4 ->  2 ->  1   
   6 ->  3 -> etc as for 3 above.   
   7 -> 22 -> 11 -> 34 -> 17 -> 52 -> 26 -> 13 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> see 5 above.   
   
Write a program that reads a number and prints the Ulam sequence for it.
